This is a very tiny Perl binding which has one single function call which uses
a few functions in SimGear. It is mainly by fg_server_xml.cgi to convert the
orientation values from the FG server into heading/pitch/roll.

Part of SimGear codes are now copied into sgmath.cxx, so that this module does
not depends on SimGear and PLIB anymore.

Precompiled binaries are no longer included in the repo. You need to compile
this for your platform. You'll need swig (apt-get install swig on Debian) to
rebuild this. A 'make clean' followed by a 'make' should do it,
