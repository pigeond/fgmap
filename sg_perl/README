This is a very tiny Perl binding which has one single function call which uses
a few functions in SimGear. It is mainly by fg_server_xml.cgi to convert the
orientation values from the FG server into heading/pitch/roll.

For convenience the binary for x86 is included in the tree.

If you need to, say, host FGMap on a platform other than x86, you'll want to
build this yourself. You'll need swig to rebuild this. A 'make clean' followed
by a 'make' should do it,

Also you might want to edit the makefile (not Makefile, so that it won't be
confused with those Makefile.PL etc) for the location of SimGear and PLIB.
